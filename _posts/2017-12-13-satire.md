title: Satire

<p>Satire is as old as Aristophanes himself. It is the kind of humor that can provoke people into action, topple leaders, and and incite change. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, 
  
  <q><b>Satire</b>, artistic form, chiefly literary and dramatic, in which human or individual vices, follies, abuses, or shortcomings are held up to censure by means of ridicule, derision, burlesque, irony, parody, caricature, or other methods, sometimes with an intent to inspire social reform.</q></p>

<p>A few examples:</p>

<p>Satire is often used as a front to point out political shortcomings. Unfortunately, not everyone can “take the joke” or view it as constructive criticism. Thus, satirists are often censored or persecuted for their jokes. Satire shows that humor can be a truly powerful thing and can have real consequences beyond just making someone cry.</p>
