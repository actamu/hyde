Everyone has a funny bone in their body but the question always comes down to what kind of humor they have to go along with it. Scott Adams, the writer and creator of the comic <a href="http://dilbert.com/">Dilbert</a>, created a formula he believes figures out what manner of humor people have called <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/2015/03/26/humor-writing-tutorial/">Six Dimensions of Humor</a>. His understanding is that everybody has a difference sense of humor since everyone does not find the same things funny. However, by fusing various types of humor together in something humorous, people have a higher likelihood to relate with whomever their audience may be. 

For his concept to work, the general rule stands that at least two of his six dimensions of humor need to be apparent in the comedic content. Of course, more dimensions involved, the better. The six dimensions of humor are the following:

<ol>
  <li><b>Bizarre</b>: surreal.</li>
  <li><b>Clever</b>: riddles and puns.</li>
  <li><b>Cruel</b>: slapstick and dark humor.</li>
  <li><b>Cute</b>: animals and kids.</li>
  <li><b>Naughty</b>: dirty jokes.</li>
  <li><b>Recognizable</b>: situational, references, inside jokes, and running gags.</li>
</ol>
