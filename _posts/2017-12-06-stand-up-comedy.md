Stand-up comedy is a style of humor where the entertainer executes their performance in front of a live audience in a pub, bar, theater, or at live shows on television if they are lucky. The comedian usually rides solo on stage while telling jokes or amusing stories directly to the audience. These types of performances are also known as monologues, routines, or acts. 

Some background about stand-up comedy is that it originates from Greek roots in 400 BC. It was mainly used as a means to reveal to audiences reality without worrying about censorship. Cynics and Epicureans of that time period predominantly used stand-up for that reason. 

Today, the material comedians write, direct, and perform in their monologues are picked through trial-and-error because a person does not just wakeup hilarious one day. No. Comedians work hard to figure out what different kinds of audiences find funny and choose their material this way. In fact, being a comedian is kind of like being a sleuth on the case to figure out what kind of humor speaks to the audience more than others, whether the material is proven to be funny through experience or it is new material waiting to be tested.

A number of comedians known today are world-renown for their stand-up abilities due their strong skills of impromptu jokes and witty statements when they interact with the crowd. A handful of these noble people who provide comedy gold live include Robin Williams, Jerry Seinfeld, Kevin Hart, Iliza Shlesinger, Jay Leno, Amy Schumer, and more!
