As far back as third century BC, songs and poetry have been recreated as parodies. Greek writer Hegemon of Thasos was one of the first to alter the wording of well known poems. Roman parodies imitated the style of famous writers to create a humorous effect. Shakespeare’s sonnet #130, My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun can be regarded as a parody as it mimics the popularized poetic conventions, but twisted the words so that the sonnet has a contrary message. 

The first time the actual word parody was used in English wasn’t until 1598 when Ben Johnson wrote "A Parodie, a parodie! to make it absurder than it was," in his book, Every Man in His Humor. For almost another century the word did not find its way into texts until John Dryden expanded the definition of the term as satirical poetry that “turned into another sense than their author intended,” in 1693.

In the Twentieth century, the parody began to reach its height and many sub genres were created. These include Recontextualized parody which incorporates elements from many other texts, modern parody which ridicules a certain subject rather the text it imitates, and Pastiche which mimics visual art. Even works such as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead are regarded as parody due to the borrowing of characters from Shakespeare while recreating the same scenes in a comedic perspective, similar to fan fiction today. 

Recently, parodies have expanded beyond literature and poetry as new mediums have been introduced. Films chock full of parodies are sought out for their hilarity, including Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Artist “Weird Al” Yankovic is one of the most well known examples of musical parody. Many artists who have had music reinvented by him regard it as an honor.
