title: What is news?

This tab will include articles of all sorts from describing various types of humor, why humor exists, how humor is a type of rhetoric, and more. 

  > Articles will be written by members of the group as well as have articles hyperlinked with comical information readers may find interesting. For the sake of the mockup, we are leaving the help posts at the bottom of this page for references and will get rid of them for the final product. Thank you and look forward to our final product!!!
