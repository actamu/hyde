A surprising amount of our humor today can trace its roots back to ancient Sparta. Their prefered style was called Laconic phrase, named for the inhabitants of a region in Sparta known for their pithy, blunt remarks. These men of few words had a dry wit that rivaled the refined humor of the Athens.

Given in the same context as the movie 300, a payment of earth and water as a symbol of surrender was demanded from the Spartans by a Persian messenger. While the Hollywood quote “This is Sparta” was not the historically accurate wording, the original quip is arguably even better. King Leonidas of Sparta, responded with, “dig it out for yourselves,” before throwing the messenger down a well.

After he had several key footholds under his command, Philip decided to start putting pressure on Sparta, and sent them the threat seen in the image above. The Spartan’s sent back the single word “if” in reply.

Thought the quote “Come and take them” originated with the Alamo? There is actually an earlier application of this challenge issued by King Leonidas of Sparta. In 480 BC, the Persian King Xerxes demanded the Spartans surrender their weapons. Upon hearing this threat order from an army that outnumbered his own 200 to 1, Leonidas’ response was “Molon Labe”, translating fairly accurately to “Come and take them.”

The Spartans excelled in a terse and daring style of humor that is still amusing centuries later. So has our sense of humor actually evolved, or do we still use similar jokes today with content being the only difference?
