## April Fool's Day
<a href="url"><img src="https://actamu.github.io/laughing-aggies/public/images/april-fools-day-mountain.jpg" height="275" width="400" ></a>

April the first is a day long anticipated or long dreaded and has been for centuries. The original cause of this day’s practical jokes is unknown, but it was popularized in the 1700s and continues today. 

One of the greatest pranks ever pulled on this occasion occurred at Sitka, Alaska in 1974. The mastermind, Porky, describes the stunt in an advertisement campaign; “On April Fool's Day, I hired a chopper and flew 70 old, kerosene-soaked tires on top of the dormant volcano, Mount Edgecumbe, that looms over Sitka. I set the tires on fire, and the billowing, black smoke created one hell of a commotion in Sitka. I dare you to top that April Fool's joke." After realizing that the apparent active volcano was a hoax, the community gave their wholehearted approval. This prank epitomizes the aims of April Fool’s in which we many still aspire to baffle in more innovative and extravagant ways. 

Another of the greatest April Fools pranks was pulled by Taco Bell in 1996. This fast food company fooled many when it claimed to have purchased and renamed Philadelphia's Liberty Bell to the Taco Liberty Bell.

This day alone shows a culmination of humor as it has the pranks and practices have evolved for centuries over many cultures.

## Banana Slip
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRq3XxCZXo"><img src="https://actamu.github.io/laughing-aggies/public/images/banana-peel-slip.jpg" height="275" width="400" ></a>

The banana peel is infamous for its perceived ability to bring people to tears, be it in pain or laughter. However, the banana peel is not quite as slippery as we believe. When the banana first became a comedy gag, it was a symbol for the accumulating waste clogging up the streets of late 18th century United States. At this time, there was no one to clean up the trash, leaving the peel to decompose until the inside was slick enough to slip up passerby. A single fresh peel, as demonstrated by the Mythbusters, is not a likely hazard. The gag has been so successful that the banana peels are still treated with caution and are now infamous in comedy and video games.

## Benjamin Franklin
<a href="url"><img src="https://actamu.github.io/laughing-aggies/public/images/ben_frank.jpg" height="275" width="425" ></a>

Ever fond of pseudonyms, one of Benjamin Franklin’s earliest known hoaxes was put into play after he was denied publications for his writings. This publisher was Franklin’s elder brother, making the story that of a very interesting sibling feud. Under the pen name Silence Dogood, supposedly a middle-aged widow, Franklin submitted a humorous letter to the editor. He was so successful in with his letters that several marriage proposals were sent to Dogood. After unveiling the hoax, his elder brother was less than amused, but this was only the beginning of Franklin’s practical jokes.

Many of Franklin’s writings over the years were intended as rhetoric. However, Ben felt that one of the most effective methods to gain a larger audience was through sensationalism and humour. He wrote “The Speech of Miss Polly Baker,” a fictional and humorous piece with roots from actual events that combated a double standard for sexism at court. To win the sympathies of British citizens during the Revolutionary war, he published many wild stories including one letter that claimed the British recruited Native Americans to scalp colonists. This particular hoax wasn’t found out for another 70 years. Another of his works challenging societal issues included The Federal Gazette which combatted slavery by using anti-abolitionist theology against them. There are many who believe that Franklin’s efforts greatly impacted the abolishment of slavery long after his death. These stories were sensational for their bizarre, humorous, fictional accounts, yet each had a strong impact on public opinion, and our society now is heavily shaped by the arguments these rhetoric represent. This Father of Satires demonstrated that writings as strange as those found in the Onion today, actually use humour to effectively shape their audience’s perceptions.

## Jane Zei of <i>The Pigeon Gazette</i>
<a href="url"><img src="https://actamu.github.io/laughing-aggies/public/images/jane-zei-pigeon-gazette.jpg" height="250" width="325" ></a>

[<i>The Pigeon Gazette</i>](http://thepigeongazette.tumblr.com/) is a semi-autobiographical comic created by the cartoonist, Jane Zei. Jane is a young adult millennial who began her career in the comic world in 2015 due to her love for drawing and making people happy from her work. She focuses her comics mostly on self-deprecating humor because she feels happy at being able to make other people laugh at her own expense. She also enjoys incorporating quirky cultural references and laugh-at-life kind of humor into her her work depending on her mood and life experiences at the time.

Jane is a great example of how humor has evolved in modern culture with expectations in today's society. While focusing on her own life experiences, she integrates daily news, what people expect of her in her demographic (i.e. age, gender, etc.), and more while putting a spin on her stories with some kind of punchline for humor.

## Kilroy, an Early Meme?
<a href="url"><img src="https://actamu.github.io/laughing-aggies/public/images/kilroy.jpg" height="275" width="400" ></a>

Kilroy, a cartoon of a man looking over a wall grew in popularity among American soldiers during World War II and was inscribed inside helmets, prison walls, and restrooms stalls. This figure grew beyond a simple humorous and recognizable meme for the soldiers. It is rumored to have Hitler was convinced that Kilroy was the codename of a spy. Joseph Stalin was flabbergasted himself we he came across Kilroy graffiti in the VIP bathroom at the Potsdam Conference in 1945. 

Originally known to the United Kingdom as "Mr Chad", the cartoon would be accompanied by the slogan "Wot, no sugar", or another phrase influenced by a rations shortage. He often appeared with a single curling hair that resembled a question mark and with crosses in his eyes. The earliest known doodle in street art is drawn in chalk on a wall, dated May 13th, 1937 in Fort Knox, Kentucky.

Kilroy is now seen in popular works such as Charlie Brown, Doctor Who, and Popeye. This is an almost century old meme that once had the power to baffle world leaders and bring U.S. soldiers together. Next time someone complains about the emerging of such media, let them in on the history of this little guy.

## Seth McFarlone
<a href="url"><img src="https://actamu.github.io/laughing-aggies/public/images/seth-macfarlane.jpg" height="300" width="400" ></a>

An incredibly talented voice actor, Seth MacFarlane is the creator of Family Guy and voices four of the main characters and various recurring characters. He is also responsible for the creation of American Dad, another adult cartoon show. He voices two of the main characters on that show. His ability to sound like so many different characters is truly astounding!

MacFarlane attended the Rhode Island School of Design and studied animation. After his schooling, he proceeded to establish himself as renowned voice actor with a career starting in 1995 through the present day.

Macfarlane's humor is often crude, violent, and downright controversial. His shows have repeatedly come under fire for a whole host of offensive one liners and depictions of violence. Yet his shows are among the longest running in cartoon history. While some viewers find his brand of comedy "too much", others enjoy the over-the-top antics and blatent disregard for social boundaries. The shows aren't for everyone, but that doesn't stop others from finding the shows humorous.

## Walt Disney
<a href="url"><img src="https://actamu.github.io/laughing-aggies/public/images/walt-disney.jpg" height="300" width="300" ></a>

<i>“Childishness? I think it’s the equivalent of never losing your sense of humor. I mean, there’s a certain something that you retain. It’s the equivalent of not getting so stuffy that you can’t laugh at others.”</i> ~Walt Disney

Disney animations have pulled on the heartstrings of children for generations. His cartoons were made possible only after enduring many hardships himself; he grew up in poverty, his first studio went bankrupt, and had to mortgage his house to create his first epic movie. But these hardships shaped what would later become the classic Disney brand. Even the creation of Mickey Mouse was a result of a bad business deal. In his own words, Disney described the humor that inspired him,“I can’t laugh at intellectual humor, you know? I want to be hit here. I’m just corny enough. I want to be hit right here in the heart.” The Disney brand has an innocent and lasting humor that is still influential today.

## William Shakespeare Comedies
<a href="url"><img src="https://actamu.github.io/laughing-aggies/public/images/william-shakespeare.jpg" height="275" width="450" ></a>

William Shakespeare became one of the most well known authors of all time, and his works are filled with humor. Much of the references and jokes he made are lost on the average reader today due to a change in the times and experience. However, one can imagine the Globe Theater filled with peasants and nobility of all ages and backgrounds breaking into laughter at Shakespeare’s clever humor and dirtier jokes. Many of his comedies used humor in the form of misconception (Much Ado about Nothing), mockery (Taming of the Shrew), and even disguising characters as the opposite gender (As You Like It and The Twelfth Night).

Shakespeare is even responsible for many of the words and references we use in expressions today, including:
<ul>
  <li>Knock, knock. Who’s there? <i>(Macbeth)</i></li>
  <li>Wild goose chase. <i>(Romeo and Juliet)</i></li>
  <li>In a pickle. <i>(The Tempest)</i></li>
  <li>For goodness’ sake. <i>(Henry VIII)</i></li>
  <li>Laughing stock. <i>(The Merry Wives of Windsor)</i></li>
  <li>It’s Greek to me. <i>(Julius Caesar)</i></li>
</ul>

You read that right, Shakespeare is the responsible the knock knock jokes you pestered your parents with as a child. For a bit of fun, here is a list of some knock knock jokes to have you roll your eyes and share with a friend.

## Winston Churchill: Unlikely One-Liner King
<a href="url"><img src="https://actamu.github.io/laughing-aggies/public/images/winston-churchill.jpg" height="275" width="400" ></a>

We’ve all known one of those rare individuals who have an uncanny wit. One of the most well known and often quoted was WWII prime minister Winston Churchill. Though Churchill was a gifted statesman with an extensive education, he reached much greater heights. He was an author, military officer, and spokesman. His inspirational speeches as moving as his humor was clever. Many today unwittingly reference him or are unaware they have likely heard many of his remarks before.

Many of his more recognizable quotes are clever, concise, and somewhat dry.
<ul>
  <li>"Tact is the ability to tell someone to go to hell in such a way that they look forward to the trip."</li>
  <li>"History is written by the victors."</li>
</ul>
It is also easy to imagine Churchill as a contender for a reality TV show with his quick quips:
<ul>
  <li>Lady Astor: "Winston, if I were your wife I'd put poison in your coffee."</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Winston Churchill: "Nancy, if I were your husband I'd drink it."</li>
  </ul>
  <li>"A lady came up to me one day and said 'Sir! You are drunk', to which I replied 'I am drunk today madam, and tomorrow   I shall be sober but you will still be ugly."</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This was thought to have been inspired by lines from the 1934 film It’s a Gift. In the film, when told he was drunk,      one of the characters responded with “Yeah, and you’re crazy. But I’ll be sober tomorrow and you’ll be crazy the rest       of your life.”</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
Churchill’s sharp tongue and indomitable spirit greatly contributed to a legacy not just for his military efforts, but though his writings and wit as well.  The WWII prime minister inspired nations gripped in war and still his humorous wisdom is well known today.

## World War II Hoax: Carrots & Eyesight
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8544x9GWQPE"><img src="https://actamu.github.io/laughing-aggies/public/images/carrots-nightsight.jpg" height="400" width="300"></a>

Even into the 21st century, parents are still telling their children to eat carrots to help improve their eyesight. Unfortunately, carrots due not have quite the effect we would like to believe. The myth began as WWII propaganda. The UK had a new radar technology that helped their airforce locate enemy bombers. To keep this secret, they informed the press that a diet rich in carrots improved their pilot’s eyesight. Although there is little evidence the German military actually believed the rumor, the belief that carrots improve eyesight grew in the general public and the hoax lives on today.
