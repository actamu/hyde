## Benjamin Franklin

Ever fond of pseudonyms, one of Benjamin Franklin’s earliest known hoaxes was put into play after he was denied publications for his writings. This publisher was Franklin’s elder brother, making the story that of a very interesting sibling feud. Under the pen name Silence Dogood, supposedly a middle-aged widow, Franklin submitted a humorous letter to the editor. He was so successful in with his letters that several marriage proposals were sent to Dogood. After unveiling the hoax, his elder brother was less than amused, but this was only the beginning of Franklin’s practical jokes.

Many of Franklin’s writings over the years were intended as rhetoric. However, Ben felt that one of the most effective methods to gain a larger audience was through sensationalism and humour. He wrote “The Speech of Miss Polly Baker,” a fictional and humorous piece with roots from actual events that combated a double standard for sexism at court. To win the sympathies of British citizens during the Revolutionary war, he published many wild stories including one letter that claimed the British recruited Native Americans to scalp colonists. This particular hoax wasn’t found out for another 70 years. Another of his works challenging societal issues included The Federal Gazette which combatted slavery by using anti-abolitionist theology against them. There are many who believe that Franklin’s efforts greatly impacted the abolishment of slavery long after his death. These stories were sensational for their bizarre, humorous, fictional accounts, yet each had a strong impact on public opinion, and our society now is heavily shaped by the arguments these rhetoric represent. This Father of Satires demonstrated that writings as strange as those found in the Onion today, actually use humour to effectively shape their audience’s perceptions.

## Kilroy, an Early Meme?
<a href="url"><img src="https://actamu.github.io/laughing-aggies/public/images/kilroy.jpg" height="275" width="400" ></a>

Kilroy, a cartoon of a man looking over a wall grew in popularity among American soldiers during World War II and was inscribed inside helmets, prison walls, and restrooms stalls. This figure grew beyond a simple humorous and recognizable meme for the soldiers. It is rumored to have Hitler was convinced that Kilroy was the codename of a spy. Joseph Stalin was flabbergasted himself we he came across Kilroy graffiti in the VIP bathroom at the Potsdam Conference in 1945. 

Originally known to the United Kingdom as "Mr Chad", the cartoon would be accompanied by the slogan "Wot, no sugar", or another phrase influenced by a rations shortage. He often appeared with a single curling hair that resembled a question mark and with crosses in his eyes. The earliest known doodle in street art is drawn in chalk on a wall, dated May 13th, 1937 in Fort Knox, Kentucky.

Kilroy is now seen in popular works such as Charlie Brown, Doctor Who, and Popeye. This is an almost century old meme that once had the power to baffle world leaders and bring U.S. soldiers together. Next time someone complains about the emerging of such media, let them in on the history of this little guy.

<a href="url"><img src="https://actamu.github.io/laughing-aggies/public/images/winston-churchill.jpg" height="275" width="400" ></a>

We’ve all known one of those rare individuals who have an uncanny wit.One of the most well known and often quoted was WWII prime minister Winston Churchill. Though Churchill was a gifted statesman with an extensive education, he reached much greater heights. He was an author, military officer, and spokesman. His inspirational speeches as moving as his humor was clever. Many today unwittingly reference him or are unaware they have likely heard many of his remarks before.

Many of his more recognizable quotes are clever, concise, and somewhat dry.
<ul>
  <li>"Tact is the ability to tell someone to go to hell in such a way that they look forward to the trip."</li>
  <li>"History is written by the victors."</li>
</ul>
It is also easy to imagine Churchill as a contender for a reality TV show with his quick quips:
<ul>
  <li>Lady Astor: "Winston, if I were your wife I'd put poison in your coffee."</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Winston Churchill: "Nancy, if I were your husband I'd drink it."</li>
  </ul>
  <li>"A lady came up to me one day and said 'Sir! You are drunk', to which I replied 'I am drunk today madam, and tomorrow   I shall be sober but you will still be ugly."</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This was thought to have been inspired by lines from the 1934 film It’s a Gift. In the film, when told he was drunk,      one of the characters responded with “Yeah, and you’re crazy. But I’ll be sober tomorrow and you’ll be crazy the rest       of your life.”</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
Churchill’s sharp tongue and indomitable spirit greatly contributed to a legacy not just for his military efforts, but though his writings and wit as well.  The WWII prime minister inspired nations gripped in war and still his humorous wisdom is well known today.
