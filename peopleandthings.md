## Kilroy, an Early Meme?
<a href="url"><img src="https://actamu.github.io/laughing-aggies/public/images/kilroy.jpg" height="275" width="400" ></a>

Kilroy, a cartoon of a man looking over a wall grew in popularity among American soldiers during World War II and was inscribed inside helmets, prison walls, and restrooms stalls. This figure grew beyond a simple humorous and recognizable meme for the soldiers. It is rumored to have Hitler was convinced that Kilroy was the codename of a spy. Joseph Stalin was flabbergasted himself we he came across Kilroy graffiti in the VIP bathroom at the Potsdam Conference in 1945. 

Originally known to the United Kingdom as "Mr Chad", the cartoon would be accompanied by the slogan "Wot, no sugar", or another phrase influenced by a rations shortage. He often appeared with a single curling hair that resembled a question mark and with crosses in his eyes. The earliest known doodle in street art is drawn in chalk on a wall, dated May 13th, 1937 in Fort Knox, Kentucky.

Kilroy is now seen in popular works such as Charlie Brown, Doctor Who, and Popeye. This is an almost century old meme that once had the power to baffle world leaders and bring U.S. soldiers together. Next time someone complains about the emerging of such media, let them in on the history of this little guy.
